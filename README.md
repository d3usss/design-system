Design system library for my projects, built with web components (Lit.js), documented and tested with Storybook.

## ✨ Overview

This is a personal design system focused on building reusable, framework-agnostic web components using Lit.js. The goal is to create a scalable component library that follows the Atomic Design methodology — starting with atoms and building up to molecules, organisms, and templates.

The project is in early development. I am starting with core foundations and will progressively build upon them.

## 📌 Status

In Progress (Beta) — foundations are being built. Expect frequent changes.
First version will for my personal website then I will try make it more generic.

- **Typescript**
- **Lit.js** - web components
- **Rollup.js** - module bundler
- **Storybook** - component documentation and e2e testing

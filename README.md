# Design System (One Dev Republic)

![One Dev Republic - Łukasz Migut](./storybook/public/one-dev-republic-logo.png)

Design system library for my projects, built with web components (Lit.js), documented and tested with Storybook.

## ✨ Overview

This is a personal design system focused on building reusable, framework-agnostic web components using Lit.js. The goal is to create a scalable component library that follows the Atomic Design methodology — starting with atoms and building up to molecules, organisms, and templates.

The project is in early development. I am starting with core foundations and will progressively build upon them.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Typescript**
- **Lit.js** — web components
- **Rollup.js** — module bundler
- **Storybook** — component documentation and e2e testing (future)
- **ESLint** — linting
- **Prettier** — code formatting
- **pnpm** — package manager with workspaces (monorepo)
